slice strings in python :
    res_s = s[ start_pos:stop_pos:step ]
* res_s stores the returned sub-string,
* s is the given string,
* start_pos is the starting index from which we need to slice the string s,
* stop_pos is the stoping index , before which the slicing operation would end ,
* step is the steps the slicing process would take from start_pos to end_pos.
